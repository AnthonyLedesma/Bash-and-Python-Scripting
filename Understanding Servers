Files/Directories
1: make a directory
- mkdir <dirname>
2: delete a directory
- rm -rf <dirname> (remember CWD | recursive force)
3: move into a directory, and back out.
- cd <dirname> + cd <.. up a level | ~ users home dir)
4: rename a directory
- cp -a <dirname> /parent/child/<newDirName>  (-a archive) | (-pr preserver file attributes, recursive copy)
5: copy a directory (and all of its contents)
- cp -pr ./<dirname>/ /parent/child/<newDirName>
7: list files in a directory
- ls 
8: list all files, in "long" or "list" format using human readable sizes 
- ls -la (list, all files)

Users
1: create a user
- useradd <username>    |   https://www.centos.org/docs/5/html/5.1/Deployment_Guide/s2-users-add.html
2: change that users password (or set it since it probably does not yet exist)
- passwd <username>
3: find a users user id 
- awk -F':' '{ print $1 }' /etc/passwd/   OR cat /etc/passwd/

Accessing internet resources
1: download a file via http (into current directory)
- curl -o /tmp/<filename.ext> 'https://en-ca.wordpress.org/wordpress-4.9.5-en_CA.zip'
2: download a file using ftp (into current directory)
- ftp domain.com
- username + password
- ftp> ls
- ftp> cd directory
- lcd /home/user/yourdirectoryname (If you dont specify the download directory, the file will be downloaded to the current directory where you were at the time you started the FTP session.)
- lpwd			#print working directory on local host
- get file | mget *.xls
- put /path/file | mput *.xls
- quit
3: download a file using sftp (into current directory)
- sftp <user>@<host or ip>
- get -r <dirname>
4: download a file via Rsync or SCP (into current directory) https://www.tecmint.com/rsync-local-remote-file-synchronization-commands/
- rsync -avzh root@192.168.0.100:/home/tarunika/rpmpkgs /tmp/myrpms   (archive mode, increase verbosity, compress during transfer, human readable)
- rsync -avzhe ssh root@192.168.0.100:/root/install.log /tmp/ (-e command | We will be using “ssh” with “-e” option)
5: curl a page (so you can see what it says!) https://curl.haxx.se/docs/httpscripting.html#GET
- curl <https://url to curl.tld>

File/Directory ownership and permissions
1: change the owner of a file to someone else
-chown <user> <filename>
2: change the group of a file to another group
-chown :<group> <filename>
3: change the owner and group of a file at the same time (https://www.thegeekstuff.com/2012/06/chown-examples)
- chown <user>:<group> <file>
4: change the perms of a file (readme.txt ??) to 755 
- chmod 754 <file>
    4 stands for "read",
    2 stands for "write",
    1 stands for "execute", and
    0 stands for "no permission."
